Is there some historical context that you can provide (e.g. what was known about the problem before the technique/approach that you have considered was developed).\nGiven that you have introduced the reader to some key background ideas, what are the aims of the work?\nPlease note that we offer a broad range of project and the aims will reflect this. For example, you might aim to:\n\nwork through a proof of a theorem\ndevelop a mathematical model of some system (that you will have introduced above)\ndevelop an implementation of a method to solve a certain class of problem\napply a technique in the analysis of a dataset\netc.\n\nBy the end of the introduction, you should have placed your project in context and outlined what you are going to do.\nHere is a reference (Knuth (1984)).\n\n\n\n\nKnuth, Donald E. 1984. “Literate Programming.” Comput.
